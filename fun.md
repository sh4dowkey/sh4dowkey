##The Pentester Cycle 🕵️‍♂️💻

- Get scope document
- Scan targets
- Find nothing at first
- Cry internally
- Fuzz until something breaks
- Land a low-severity bug
- Chain it into domain admin
- Celebrate quietly
- Write report for 10x longer than the hack took
- Client `fixes` it… but you exploit it again next week 😏

## 👀 Daily Mood

```
while (alive) {
    try {
        code();
        hack();
    } catch (burnout) {
        coffee++;
    }
}
```

## If you've made it this far...
You either:
- Need a break 🧠
- Or you're *also* questioning your life choices...
